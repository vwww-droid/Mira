# Releasing Mira

The `release-tag-build` workflow creates a draft GitHub Release. It publishes the Python and unsigned iOS artifacts to that draft. Its Android APK uses an ephemeral CI debug key and remains an Actions artifact for package verification only.

Build the public Android APK with the maintainer's existing local debug key:

```bash
MIRA_FRIDA_COMPAT_OUTPUT_DIR="$PWD/dist/android" \
MIRA_FRIDA_COMPAT_OUTPUT_APK="$PWD/dist/android/mira-app-debug.apk" \
  ./tools/android/build-frida-16.7-compat-apk.sh
```

Before publishing the draft:

1. Verify the APK version, Frida version, SHA-256 digest, ZIP alignment, signature, and expected signing certificate.
2. Upload it as `mira-app-debug.apk` and record its digest in the release notes.
3. Download every public asset and compare it with the verified source artifact.
4. Confirm the draft contains `mira-app-debug.apk`. Never publish a draft without the Android APK.

Do not upload a signing key to GitHub Actions. A certificate change prevents Android from installing the release as an update over builds signed by the previous certificate.
